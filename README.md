Pandemic Simulation

Only program 2 must be run. 
Each dot in the animation represents a person: Grey-Uninfected, Red-Infected, Green-Recovered, Black-Dead.
The overall result is displayed in a line graph, charting the number of active cases vs time.
It is used to draw a comparison between the 2 situations: when precautions are ignored and when they are followed.
